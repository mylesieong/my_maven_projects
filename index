1. I use maven to build these projects:
   a) my-app: follow maven.apache.org tutorial, build the standard project from scratch
   b) **spring_maven: follow spring.io tutorial on maven build java project, its only a java project without adding spring element, but its demos dependency on joda-time.
   c) my-spring-demo: follow mkyong blog to build spring 2.5 but since I didnt export it to eclipse, there is a error on the last step when i try to call the java entrance.
   d) SpringExample: this is the package provide by mkyong.

	mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.*.* -DartifactId=* -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
